-------------------------
Owner : CERT team, CollabNet. Inc.
Version : 1.0
Release : 4
Mail : dev-cert_cee_engineering@forge.collab.net

This utility sends monitored results to the centralized graphite based monitoring system.
By default to metrics.collab.net

How is this structured?
----------------------
- bin
  "bin" directory has all executables, that runs the whole monitor utility

- conf
  Has the configuration file to configure the target graphite server

- script-snips
  This folder got all script snips that the parent script from bin directory runs.
  Every script in this snip should print result in below format

  <name> <value>
  name like => cust.$HOST.<category>.<type>.<metric>
       for example => cust." host_name ".db.conn.now , which means 
               current value of conneciton type under db category

- templates
  This folder has some known templates that can be used. 
  All that needs to be done is copy the required template to "script-snips" folder and make it as executable.

How to check if the script-snips are fine?
------------------------------------------

Just run "/var/ops/monitor/bin/scripts_wrapper.sh"
This will execute all scripts under script-snips and print response.
Sample response will be as below...
